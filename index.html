						Brownian motion, also known as <strong>pedesis</strong>,
						refers to the random, erratic movement of particles
						suspended in a fluid (gas or liquid) due to collisions
						with the fast-moving molecules in the surrounding
						medium.
					</p>
					<p>
						The phenomenon was first observed by the botanist
						<strong>Robert Brown</strong> in 1827 while examining
						pollen grains suspended in water. The importance of
						Brownian motion became widely recognized when
						<strong>Albert Einstein</strong> in 1905, and later
						<strong>Marian Smoluchowski</strong>, developed a
						theoretical explanation linking it to molecular kinetic
						theory, helping establish the atomic nature of matter.

						In the background you can see an animation illustrating
						the principle of Brownian motion. The large gray
						particle moves chaotically, colliding with other small
						particles.

							Brownian motion is an essential concept across many
							fields, including physics, chemistry, biology, and
							finance. It provides insight into the random
							processes in nature and forms the basis of several
							stochastic models. In a more technical sense, it
							serves as a model for
							<strong>diffusion</strong>, which is the spreading
							of particles from regions of higher concentration to
							regions of lower concentration.

								<strong>Key Features of Brownian Motion</strong>
							</div>
							<li>
								<strong>Randomness</strong>: Brownian motion is
								inherently unpredictable and follows a random
								path. Each step of the particle is determined by
								the sum of many independent molecular
								collisions.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Continuous Trajectories</strong>:
								Although the particle's movement is erratic, it
								follows a continuous path without sudden jumps.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Markov Property</strong>: The future
								state of the system (particle position) depends
								only on its present state and not on its past
								behavior.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong
									>Gaussian Probability Distribution</strong
								>: Over time, the position of a Brownian
								particle follows a normal distribution due to
								the Central Limit Theorem.
